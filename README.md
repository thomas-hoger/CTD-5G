## Current status

Development is currently ongoing. Three network surfaces are already well covered, both in terms of attacks and benign traffic. The next step involves implementing attacks targeting the access network.

| Network Surface            | Attacks | Benigns |
|---------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|
| Core Network Management   |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Session Management        |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| User Traffic Encapsulation |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Access Network            |   ❌    |   ✅    |
| Mobility Control          |   ❌    |   ❌    |
| Slicing                  |   ❌    |   ❌    |

## Supported features

Detailed descriptions are available in the [src/attacks](./src/attacks) and [src/benign](./src/benign) directories.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> A working 5G simulator is required to use this codebase. Please ensure the simulator is running before starting any experiments.

### Install the 5G CN and RAN simulator 
```
git clone https://github.com/thomas-hoger/free5gc-compose.git
cd free5gc-compose
docker compose up -d
```
### Install the dataset generator
```
git clone https://github.com/thomas-hoger/CTD-5G.git
cd CTD-5G
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Run the dataset generator
You can launch the generator using the CLI:
```
python run.py [-d DURATION (in minuts)] -t {benign,attack} 
```
Alternatively, use the provided bash script to run both benign and attack procedures in the background while capturing traffic with `tcpdump`
```
./run.sh
```
### Expected output
Logs are generated by the Python script to monitor the execution process. When using the bash script, logs are redirected to the `output` directory.

[Benign Traffic] [22:26:45] Running procedure 1: register_random_ue
Registering imsi-208930000000951
Procedure finished with result: ✅
Current UE states : UE-0569 😀, UE-0881 😀, UE-0951 😀
Current NFs : 3e638adc, 1c0a87cb
==============================
[Benign Traffic] [22:27:05] Running procedure 2: set_random_ue_idle
Setting UE imsi-208930000000569 to idle
Procedure finished with result: ✅
Current UE states : UE-0569 😴, UE-0881 😀, UE-0951 😀
Current NFs : 3e638adc, 1c0a87cb
```
This output includes : 
- The name and timestamp of the procedure
- Execution result (✅ or ❌)
- Current list of UEs and their states (😀 = Connected, 😴 = Idle)
- Registered NFs
- Additional debug information

### Unit tests
To validate modifications or review how individual procedures work, you can run unit tests:
```
python -m pytest
python -m pytest src/attacks/api_cn/tests
```

## Troubleshooting
### Making changes on the code
### Upgrading free5gc
### Upgrading ueransim 
### UE registration keeps failing
If UE registration repeatedly fails, it's often a sign that the **core network is not functioning properly**. This is often due to:
- A critical network function (NF) being down or misconfigured.
- The NRF (Network Repository Function) not responding or rejecting registrations and/or JWT creation.
- création de token oauth refusé par le NRF
Make sure all essential NFs are running and correctly registered with the NRF. You can check the current NF list and status using the `get_nf_info` function available in [`src/utils/protocols/api_cn/instance.py`](src/utils/protocols/api_cn/instance.py).
